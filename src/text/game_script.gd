###### Forest
## Clearing
# Hole
var Forest_Clearing_Hole_Look = "It's a small hole in the dirt."
var Forest_Clearing_Hole_Take = "It's a hole. By definition, you cannot take it."
# Stone
var Forest_Clearing_Hole_Stone_Look = "It's a small, smooth stone."
var Forest_Clearing_Hole_Stone_Take = "You take the stone."
# Dirt Pile
var Forest_Clearing_Dirt_Look = "It's a little pile of soft soil. It must be from the hole next to it."

## Bridge South
# Bridge
var Forest_Bridge_South_Bridge_Look = "A mighty stone bridge once spanned the river but has since mostly collapsed. Part of it still juts out from either side of the river."
var Forest_Bridge_South_Bridge_Take = "Thinking about carrying this entire bridge away makes your back hurt."
# River
var Forest_Bridge_South_River_Look = "The rushing water is a little murky. You can see dark shapes moving around in it."
var Forest_Bridge_South_River_Take = "Holding an entire river in your hands seems problematic."
# Rusty Rod
var Forest_Bridge_South_Rod_Look = "A cylindrical, rusty metal rod sticks out of the water about 5 feet from the shore."
var Forest_Bridge_South_Rod_Take_Successful = "You wade out into the river and grab the metal rod. You give it a tug but it's caught in the rocks. You work it back and forth until it's free and then make your way back to the bank."

var Game_Over_Fish_2 = "You start working it back and forth to free it when you feel a stabbing pain in your leg! It's quickly followed by another and another and another!"
var Game_Over_Fish_3 = "The murky water begins to roil as the river reddens with your blood. Gray, toothy fish begin leaping from the water in a feeding frenzy, taking chunks of your flesh before returning to the murky river."
var Game_Over_Fish_4 = "You flee back to the bank of the river but it's too late."
var Game_Over_Fish_5 = "Your head begins spinning. As everything fades to black, you have one, final thought... If only you had done something to distract the fish..."
