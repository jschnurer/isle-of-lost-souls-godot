## Bridge South
# Bridge
var Forest_Bridge_South_Bridge_Look = "A mighty stone bridge once spanned the river but has since mostly collapsed. Part of it still juts out from either side of the river."

# River

# Rusty Rod
var Forest_Bridge_South_Rod_Look = "A cylindrical, rusty metal rod sticks out of the water about 5 feet from the shore."
var Forest_Bridge_South_Rod_Take_Successful = "You wade out into the river and grab the metal rod. You give it a tug but it's caught in the rocks. You work it back and forth until it's free and then make your way back to the bank."

## Quiet Fork
# Signpost
var Forest_Quiet_Fork_Signpost_Look_With_Nail = "A rotting chunk of wood that must have once been a signpost decays in the long grass. It's been rotting away for a long, long time. The single nail that holds it together is rusty but still doing its job."

var Forest_Quiet_Fork_Nail_Take = "You get your fingernails under the head of the nail and give it a good couple tugs. Eventually, you work it out of the signpost and take it with you."

var Game_Over_Fish_4 = "You flee back to the bank of the river but it's too late."
var Game_Over_Fish_5 = "Your head begins spinning. As everything fades to black, you have one, final thought..."
var Game_Over_Fish_6 = "If only you had done something to distract the fish..."
